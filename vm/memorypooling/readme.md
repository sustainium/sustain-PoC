# Memory Pooling

Enviora aims for low transaction fees and low energy consumption, which brings us to memory optimization. The EVM wasn't built to lower fees or optimize memory usage. Although the EVM is optimized, it doesnâ€™t reduce memory consumption by smart contracts, leading to higher fees for processing complex ones.

Thus, the introduction of memory pooling into the VM: this globally optimizes memory usage by smart contracts and reduces fragmentation.

## How Does It Work?

EVM has three sets of memory: stack, memory (think of it as RAM), and storage (like hard drives). The stack follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) structure.

### Reuse Deallocated Memory Blocks

Instead of allocating new memory blocks, a smart contract reuses previously deallocated blocks. This ensures efficient recycling of memory.

```
// Allocate memory by pushing values onto the stack
PUSH1 0x01  // Example value to store
PUSH1 0x80  // Allocating memory at position 0x80
MSTORE      // Store the value at the allocated memory position
// memory[0x80] = 0x01

// Deallocate memory by pushing 0
PUSH1 0x00  // Push 0 (value to deallocate) onto the stack
PUSH1 0x80  // Memory address to deallocate
MSTORE      // Deallocate memory by setting it to 0
// memory[0x80] = 0x00

// Reuse deallocated memory
PUSH1 0x04  // Another value
PUSH1 0x80  // Deallocated memory address 
MSTORE      // Store the new value
// memory[0x80] = 0x04
```

### Efficient Memory Allocation

Each smart contract dynamically allocates and deallocates memory, reducing fragmentation and optimizing usage.

### Garbage Collection

A mechanism to identify and reclaim unused memory within each smart contract, keeping memory usage efficient and minimizing leaks.

### Cost Reduction

Optimized memory usage lowers the overall cost of executing smart contracts, leading to reduced transaction fees.

## Benefits of Memory Pooling

- **Lower Transaction Fees:** Reduced memory consumption translates to lower fees for processing complex smart contracts.
- **Improved Performance:** Optimized memory usage leads to faster execution of smart contracts, enhancing the overall performance of the EVM.
- **Scalability:** With more efficient memory management, the EVM can handle a larger number of smart contracts simultaneously, improving its scalability.

Memory pooling is a significant enhancement to the EVM, addressing key challenges related to memory usage and transaction fees. Enviora aims to create a more efficient and cost-effective environment for executing smart contracts.
