# Sustainable Dynamic Proof-of-Stake (SDPoS)

Enviora introduces a new, innovative PoS-based consensus mechanism called Sustainable Dynamic Proof-of-Stake (SDPoS), which addresses typical PoS cons and enhances overall network performance.

## How It Works

### 1. Validator Selection
- **Dynamic Stake-Based Rotation:** Validators are chosen based on their stake, but we mix it up dynamically to keep things fair and prevent any one group from monopolizing the process.
- **Inclusivity Boost:** Even small stakeholders get their turn to validate blocks, making sure everyone gets a fair shot.

### 2. Security Measures
- **Triple-Signature Scheme:** Instead of just one signature, each block requires signatures from three different validators. This makes it way more secure.
- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** We keep an eye on things constantly to detect and stop any threats as they happen.

### 3. Scalability and Throughput
- **Dynamic Sharding:** We adjust the sharding based on how busy the network is, ensuring transactions are optimally distributed.
- **Fast Confirmation Times:** Blocks get confirmed quickly with minimal delay, keeping things smooth and efficient.

### 4. Layer 2 Integration
- **State Channels:** These off-chain channels allow for quick, low-cost transactions.
- **zk-Rollups:** We bundle multiple transactions into a single rollup to boost scalability and efficiency.

### 5. Governance
- **Decentralized Voting:** Anyone can propose and vote on network changes, ensuring decisions are made collectively.
- **Liquid Democracy:** Stakeholders can delegate their voting power to trusted representatives, keeping the decision-making process active.

### 6. Energy Efficiency
- **Eco-Friendly Practices:** Validators are encouraged to adopt green practices.
- **Minimal Resource Consumption:** SDPoS uses less energy than PoW, with additional measures to further cut down on energy use.

### 7. Economic Incentives
- **Fair Rewards:** Validators are rewarded based on both their stake and performance.
- **Penalties for Misconduct:** Validators behaving badly face penalties, protecting the integrity of the network.
